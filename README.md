Report: Insights into NYC Arrest Data (2019–2023)
 
Executive Summary
I analyzed NYPD arrest data from 2019 to 2023, uncovering insights into enforcement trends, borough-level disparities, and jurisdictional activity. The data reflects the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on arrest rates, changes in precinct-level enforcement, and the dominance of specific arrest categories and jurisdictions. This report highlights key findings and actionable recommendations to enhance resource allocation and enforcement strategies.
 
Key Questions
1.	How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect arrest trends across boroughs and precincts?
2.	Which boroughs and precincts have seen the most significant changes in arrest patterns over time?
3.	What are the most common arrest categories and jurisdiction types?
4.	How can further analysis improve understanding of borough-specific risks and enforcement priorities?
 
Dataset Overview
•	Total Records: 1M+ records
•	Time Period: 2019–2023
•	Key Columns: Arrest ID, Arrest Date, Arrest Borough, Arrest Precinct, Arrest Category, Jurisdiction, Age Group, Race
 
Analysis and Insights
1. Annual Arrest Trends by Borough
•	2020: Arrests saw the largest decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with boroughs experiencing a 39–47% drop. Staten Island recorded the lowest drop (39%), while Manhattan saw the highest (47%). Arrests began dropping significantly by February 2020.
•	2021: Arrests steadily increased, with Manhattan and Staten Island showing the most recovery (+23% and +24%, respectively). The Bronx, however, only showed a marginal increase (+1%).
Observation: COVID-19 caused a significant reduction in arrests, followed by gradual recovery in 2021, particularly in Manhattan and Staten Island.
Recommendation: Examine borough-specific responses and resource allocation during the pandemic to identify gaps in enforcement.
 
2. Precinct Analysis
•	Pre-COVID: The Bronx's Arrest Precinct 40 led in arrests, closely followed by Arrest Precinct 44.
•	Post-COVID: Arrest Precinct 44 overtook Precinct 40 in 2021. In 2022, Arrest Precinct 52 emerged as a surprise second, with Precinct 40 reclaiming the top spot and Precinct 44 in third.
Observation: Precinct-level dynamics shifted significantly post-COVID, highlighting changing crime patterns or enforcement priorities.
Recommendation: Analyze specific precincts with high arrest fluctuations to identify trends and refine strategies.
 
3. Arrest Categories
•	Top Category: Misdemeanors consistently account for the most arrests.
•	Second Category: Felonies rank second, indicating a high focus on serious offenses.
Observation: The dominance of misdemeanors suggests a focus on lower-level offenses, possibly linked to quality-of-life policing.
Recommendation: Review misdemeanor trends to assess if resources are effectively addressing community safety concerns.
 
4. Jurisdiction Trends
•	Top Jurisdictions: Patrol and Transit dominate arrests, reflecting high enforcement activity in neighborhoods and transit systems.
•	Housing: Accounts for a significant share of arrests, highlighting NYPD's focus on public housing safety.
•	Non-NYPD: Arrests by external agencies are rare but noteworthy.
Observation: Patrol and Transit represent the bulk of enforcement, with Housing contributing notably. Non-NYPD activity remains limited.
Recommendation: Explore collaboration opportunities with external agencies to enhance overall safety.
 
Next Steps
1.	Conduct a deeper analysis of arrest trends by time of day and specific locations to identify high-risk areas and times.
2.	Examine the complaints-to-arrests ratio, particularly in the Bronx, to challenge popular beliefs about its perceived danger relative to other boroughs.
3.	Explore correlations between arrests and external factors such as socioeconomic indicators to refine enforcement strategies.
